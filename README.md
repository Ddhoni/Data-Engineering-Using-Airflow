# Data-Engineering-Using-Airflow

## Background
  Data Engineering is essential to address the challenges of modern data-driven policies. When institutions generate large amounts of data from multiple sources, the need for efficient data management and processing becomes critical. Data engineering transforms raw data into valuable insights by designing and implementing robust data pipelines that handle data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes, ensuring clean, integrated data from disparate sources.

  Data workflow automation is one of the things that data engineering can accomplish. Manual data processing is time-consuming and prone to errors, but tools like Apache Airflow can automate complex data workflows, reducing human intervention and minimizing errors. By setting up Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) in Airflow, data engineers can automate the scheduling and execution of tasks, ensuring timely processing and delivery of data. This automation improves operational efficiency, enabling organizations to respond quickly to changing data needs and business requirements especially for data analysis needs.

## Output
  This portfolio is an application of the basic principles of data processing in apache airflow. The final output is a python script (.py) to run apache-airflow for workflow data automation to be run locally.

## Apache Airflow

### Introduction to Apache Airflow
Apache Airflow is an open-source platform designed to automatically create, schedule, and manage workflows. Originally developed by the team at Airbnb in 2014, Apache Airflow has become one of the most popular tools in data analysis and data processing.

Apache Airflow in data analysis provides several benefits, namely:

- Operational Efficiency: By automating workflows, the time and effort required to perform routine tasks can be significantly reduced, thereby improving overall operational efficiency.

- Consistency: Apache Airflow ensures that workflows are executed consistently as specified, thereby reducing the risk of human error and improving the accuracy of results.

- Scalability: With the ability to handle complex and large-scale workflows, Apache Airflow enables organizations to grow as their data expands without sacrificing time and manual effort.

- Flexibility: The platform allows users to easily customize workflows to meet changing business needs, making it easy to quickly adapt to change

### Directed Acrylic Graph(DAG)

To support workflow management, Apache Airflow has several components that can be seen in the figure below.
